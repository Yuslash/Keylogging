# Python Keylogger Project

üîêüìùüîç

## Overview

The Python Keylogger project is a simple yet powerful tool designed to monitor and log keystrokes on a computer. It is primarily used for security and surveillance purposes, allowing users to track keyboard activity discreetly.

## How it Works

### Initialization

The keylogger is initialized with several parameters:
- `time_interval`: The interval at which the keylogger checks for keystrokes.
- `nsfw_words_file`: The file location containing NSFW (Not Safe For Work) words for filtering.
- `bot_token`: The Telegram bot token for sending alert messages.
- `mailtrap_username` and `mailtrap_password`: Credentials for the Mailtrap SMTP server for sending email alerts.

### Keystroke Logging

- The keylogger utilizes the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events in real-time.
- It captures keystrokes and appends them to a log string.
- The log string is continuously updated as new keystrokes are detected.

### NSFW Filtering

- The keylogger checks the log for NSFW content by comparing it against a list of NSFW words loaded from a file.
- If any NSFW word is found in the log, an alert message is sent via Telegram and Mailtrap.
- The log is cleared after detecting NSFW content to prevent further logging of sensitive information.

### Alert Messaging

- The keylogger sends alert messages via Telegram and Mailtrap when NSFW content is detected.
- The Telegram bot is used to send messages to a specified chat ID.
- Mailtrap is used to send email messages to a designated recipient.

### Reporting

- The keylogger periodically prints the current log contents.
- This allows users to monitor keyboard activity in real-time.
- The log is cleared after printing to prevent duplication of data.

### Program Termination

- The keylogger can be terminated by pressing the Enter key.
- Upon termination, the program exits gracefully, ending all threads and closing resources.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Configure the keylogger with the required parameters.
3. Run the keylogger script.
4. Monitor keyboard activity and receive alerts for NSFW content.

## Dependencies

- `pynput`: Python library for monitoring and controlling input devices.
- `python-telegram-bot`: Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API.

## Conclusion

The Python Keylogger project provides a valuable tool for monitoring keyboard activity and detecting NSFW content. It offers flexibility, ease of use, and robust alerting mechanisms, making it suitable for various security and surveillance applications.
